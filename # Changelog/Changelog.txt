# Changelog
#------------------------------
# Curses
- Curse of Gluttony changed to Curse of Obscurity. You are now shrouded in darkness.
- Curse of Vulnerability changed to Curse of Folly. You will randomly do a gesture animation every 60 to 120 seconds.
- Reduced the damage multipliers but increased the HP multipliers for enemies in NG+.

# Stats
- Adjusted the stats of the Heretic, Outcast and Skeptic classes.

# Weapons
- Removed Lord's Chime.
- Removed Darkmoon Ritual Staff.
- Removed Logan's Staff.
- Fire/Dark infusion now acts like a psuedo-raw infusion, as you'll get 30% of the damage irrespective of stats.

# Status Effects
- Poison and Bleed no longer scale with Luck (Humanity).
- Increased the amount of inflict for all types, in general: 30 (for quick), 50 (for normal), 80 (for slow). This is doubled for infusions on those with innate inflict.

# Catalysts
- Spell ascension is active whilst using a catalyst at maximum reinforcement, rather than at specific stat levels.
- Removed the Dark/Non-Dark catalyst mechanic.
- Reduced the scaling on the hybrid weapons so they are mid-tier.
- Reduced the max scaling for catalysts down to 3 (from 4).
- Removed the Lord's Chime (Sacred Chime of Filianore now replaces it in terms of power).
- Pyromancy catalysts now have a 'free' 50% effectiveness of scaling, meaning they start off better than the other schools due to the reduced need for stats.
- Dark catalysts now all have both INT/FTH scaling. The total is higher than the normal catalysts, to account for the 2 stats required for max damage.
- Added some innate effects to a few of the catalysts.
- Spell buff (within a school and type) is now the same across most catalysts, except the 'starting' catalysts, which are slightly lower.
- Sacred Chime of Filianore no longer increases the AOE of healing spells (this is because that is now part of the ascension system, and the mechanic used by the chime is what enables it for all of the catalysts).

# Spells
- All Dark spells now scale from INT/FTH
- Increased the damage of normal and dark pyromancies.
- Vow of Agony now does dark damage.
- Increased damage of Way of White Corona to 200 per hit.
- Removed the limited uses from any spells that had it. Upped the cost of heals a bit.
- Vow of Agony now summons a big circle below the player, that harms enemies that walk into it. Lasts 30 seconds (hits once per second), costs 60 FP.
- Angelic Ray is now Angelic Barrage, acts a bit like crystal hail, but with a more accurate firing method.
- Limited Vow of Agony to 1 instance active at any one time.
- Added Divine Arrow: a soul arrow like miracle purchased from Rosaria.
- Added Lothric's Holy Spear: a holy soul spear miracle transposed from his soul.
- Added Proof of a Pact: summon Ledo to smash foe. Dropped by one of the judicators in the Ringed City.
- Power Within now only removes 1% per second.

# Items
- Brightbug now lasts 30 seconds and only boosts by 10%. Limited to 10 held.
- Added a few more dark spells to Yoel, to help starting dark spellcasters.

- Yhorm's flame patch lasts 15 seconds (was 8).
- Iudex Gundyr is now a early to mid-tier boss that you can face early optionally.
- Reduced the Soul of Cinder HP to 16,000 (therefore 32,000 overall).
- Reduced the melee absorptions for some bosses to make melee better against them.
- Changed the HP of the Triad members to be the same for all members, reduced their damage output a bit.
- Reduced the HP of the Demon Prince to 12,000 (therefore 36,000 overall).
- Reduced the HP of Slave Knight Gael to 20,000.

# Map
- Added warp from the lower part of Smouldering Lake to the top area, allowing you to turn off the ballista quicker.
- Player now starts in Firelink Shrine.
- Moved the Undead Pyre bonfire on to the ridge you find Siegward, rename it to Giant's Tower.

- Removed a few Corvians from the first part of Road of Sacrifices.

# Trial
